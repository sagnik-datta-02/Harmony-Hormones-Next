                    Hey there, clean queen! During your period, it's important to stay clean and comfy to help you feel your best. Make sure to change your pad or tampon regularly, about every 4-6 hours, to help keep you feeling fresh and dry. And don't forget to wash your hands before and after you use the bathroom â€“ it's a simple way to help prevent germs from spreading. If you're using pads, try to choose ones with breathable materials to help keep you comfy all day long. Remember, taking care of yourself during your period is super important, so don't be afraid to pamper yourself a little!
